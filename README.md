## 🎯 About Me

I come from a **data science background**, and I understand concepts best when I know the **story behind the data** —  
where it comes from, what it represents, and why it matters.

That mindset makes me both a **Data Analyst** and an **AI Engineer**.

I enjoy:
- 📈 Exploring data to uncover trends and insights  
- 📊 Translating analysis into meaningful business stories  
- 🧠 Building ML & LLM-based systems once the data truly makes sense  
- ⚙️ Engineering pipelines that make data and models reliable at scale  

I work across the full data & AI lifecycle:
- 📥 Data collection, cleaning, validation & feature engineering  
- 📊 Exploratory data analysis, KPIs & visualization  
- 🧠 Machine learning, deep learning, NLP & LLMs  
- 🔍 Embeddings, vector search, semantic retrieval & RAG  
- ⚙️ Data pipelines, APIs, MLOps & deployment  
- 🌐 Full-stack applications for real-world usage  

> 💡 *I don’t memorize concepts — I remember the story behind the data.*
